# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features and attributes of the houses. The model is trained on historical housing data and can be used to estimate the price of a house when provided with its relevant characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of housing information, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, etc. The dataset should be stored in a CSV file (e.g., `house_prices.csv`) and should be placed in the project's root directory.

## Pre-requisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

## Model Building

The machine learning model is built using Python and Scikit-Learn. It includes the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
4. Training the model on the training data.
5. Evaluating the model's performance on the test data.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The evaluation results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook.
